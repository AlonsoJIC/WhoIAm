    <p id="aboutMe">
      Final-year Systems Engineering student with hands-on experience building scalable applications across the full
      stack.
      I've successfully delivered projects focusing on clean architecture, optimal performance,
      and end-to-end solutions.
      <br><br>
      My technical expertise spans <strong>frontend development</strong> with Angular and React, <strong>backend
        solutions</strong> with Spring Boot, Laravel, Node.js, and .NET,
      <strong>database management</strong> with SQL Server and Oracle, and <strong>desktop applications</strong> with C#
      and Rust.
      Proficient in Git workflows, agile methodologies, and collaborative development practices.
      Familiar with DevOps practices including Docker, Linux, and cloud deployment.
      <br><br>
      Beyond these, I have experience with many other technologies and I'm a <strong>fast learner</strong> — if there's
      something I don't know yet, I'll master it quickly.
      Passionate about solving complex problems, building robust systems, and writing maintainable, well-documented
      code.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Let's build something great together!</strong>
